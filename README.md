# LangChain Agent on AWS

> A production-grade AI agent built with LangGraph, deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, with full CI/CD via GitHub Actions and infrastructure managed by Terraform. Traces every run to LangSmith.

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

---

## What this project demonstrates

- Building a **ReAct agent** with LangGraph and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Serving it through a **Streamlit chat interface**
- **Containerising** the app with Docker
- **Provisioning AWS infrastructure** (ECR, ECS Fargate, IAM, CloudWatch) with Terraform
- **Automating deployments** with GitHub Actions — every push to `main` builds, pushes and redeploys
- **Storing secrets securely** in AWS Secrets Manager (never in code or environment files)
- **Observing agent behaviour** end-to-end in LangSmith (EU region)

## How the CI/CD pipeline works

```
Push to any branch
    └── ci.yml
            ├── pip install
            ├── python import check (with dummy keys)
            └── docker build (validates Dockerfile)

Push to main
    └── deploy.yml
            ├── Configure AWS credentials (from GitHub Secrets)
            ├── Build Docker image tagged with git SHA
            ├── Push to ECR (tagged as SHA + latest)
            └── Force ECS redeploy → picks up new image automatically
```

Each deploy is fully reproducible — the image tag is the git commit SHA, so you can always trace which code is running in production.

## How secrets are handled

API keys are **never stored in code, `.env` files, or GitHub**. The flow is:

```
AWS Secrets Manager          ECS Task Definition         Running container
─────────────────────        ───────────────────         ─────────────────
openai-api-key       ──────► secrets[].valueFrom  ──────► OPENAI_API_KEY
langchain-api-key    ──────► secrets[].valueFrom  ──────► LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
```

Terraform references the secrets by name and grants the ECS execution role permission to read them. The application reads them as standard environment variables.

---

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure is managed with Terraform and deployed manually from local when changes are needed. GitHub Actions handles code deployments only.

```
Infra changes  →  terraform apply (local)
Code changes   →  git push main  →  GitHub Actions deploys automatically
```

> In a production team setup this would use an S3 backend for shared Terraform state and run `terraform apply` from CI/CD as well.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Terraform >= 1.7
- Docker
- Python 3.11+

### 1. Create secrets in AWS (one-time, manual)

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name openai-api-key --secret-string "sk-..."
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name langchain-api-key --secret-string "ls__..."
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

In your repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### 3. Provision infrastructure (first time only)

```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 4. Deploy

### 5. Access the app

After the pipeline finishes, find the public IP of the running ECS task:

**AWS Console → ECS → Clusters → ai-agent-cluster → Tasks → click on the running task → Networking → Public IP**

Or via CLI:

```bash
# Get the task ARN
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster ai-agent-cluster --service-name ai-agent-service

# Get the ENI ID from the task
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster ai-agent-cluster --tasks <task-arn> --query "tasks[0].attachments[0].details" --output table

# Get the public IP from the ENI
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --network-interface-ids <eni-id> --query "NetworkInterfaces[0].Association.PublicIp" --output text
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://<public-ip>:8501
```

> **Note:** The public IP changes every time ECS redeploys the task (on every `git push main`). This is a trade-off of not using a Load Balancer. For a stable URL you would add an ALB + Route53 (see Future improvements).

Any push to `main` triggers the full pipeline automatically.

### Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file with your keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls__...
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=ai-agent

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Agent tools

The agent ships with two demo tools. Swap them out for real integrations:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_web` | Simulated web search — replace with Tavily or SerpAPI |
| `calculate` | Evaluates mathematical expressions |

---

## Observability

Every agent run is traced to **LangSmith** automatically. Set `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` and your `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` to see:

- Full ReAct thought/action/observation chains
- Token usage per step
- Latency breakdown
- Tool call inputs and outputs

Traces are sent to the **EU region** (`https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com`).

---

## Future improvements

- S3 backend for shared Terraform state across environments
- `terraform apply` from CI/CD pipeline
- ALB + Route53 for a stable URL (currently IP changes on each redeploy)
- Canary deployments with AWS CodeDeploy
- Auto-scaling ECS tasks based on load
